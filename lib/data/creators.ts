    story: "Ayumi discovered her passion for creating jewelry after moving to Ishigaki Island five years ago. Overwhelmed by the natural beauty of the beaches and forests, she began collecting small treasures - star sand, small shells, seed pods - and preserving them in resin. What started as a personal hobby soon became her life's work as she refined her techniques and developed a distinctive style that highlights the natural beauty of Ishigaki's treasures. Through the B-type employment support program, Ayumi has found a supportive community that helps her manage the business aspects while she focuses on her creative work."

    story: "Takeshi comes from a long line of Okinawan potters, but found traditional apprenticeship challenging due to his learning differences. The B-type employment program connected him with mentors who adapted their teaching methods to match his visual learning style. Today, Takeshi is known for his expressive shisa (traditional guardian figures) and functional pieces that feature glazes inspired by the different blues of Ishigaki's coral reefs. His work honors tradition while expressing his unique perspective on Ishigaki's natural beauty."

Yumiko particularly values how the program accommodates her need for a flexible schedule while still allowing her to create and contribute to preserving important cultural traditions."

Diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, he found conventional work environments challenging, but thrives in the creative, purpose-driven atmosphere of his studio. Kenji spends hours snorkeling and diving around Ishigaki, studying the coral reefs and marine life, then captures their beauty and fragility in his vibrant paintings. His work has been featured in local conservation campaigns, and he regularly contributes a portion of his sales to coral restoration projects on the island."

    story: "Haruka discovered the therapeutic benefits of candle and soap making during her recovery from a period of depression. The methodical process of measuring, mixing, and creating products with immediate sensory feedback became a form of meditation for her. When she moved to Ishigaki to be closer to family, the B-type program helped her establish a small production studio where she creates soaps and candles inspired by the island's scents - from sugar cane and tropical fruits to sea breeze and rain forest. Haruka takes particular pride in sourcing ingredients locally and creating zero-waste packaging for her products."

    story: "Hiroshi discovered wood carving later in life, after a workplace accident left him unable to continue his construction job. During his rehabilitation, he started whittling small pieces of wood as physical therapy for his hands. What began as recovery exercises evolved into a passionate pursuit of wood carving. The B-type program provided Hiroshi with a workspace and tools that accommodate his physical limitations, as well as connections to sustainable sources of local wood. He now specializes in carving pieces that highlight the natural patterns and textures of Ishigaki's native trees, often incorporating the Japanese concept of 'wabi-sabi' – finding beauty in imperfection."

    story: "Mei's journey to papermaking began during her recovery from sensory processing challenges. The tactile nature of papermaking—feeling the fibers, controlling the water flow, pressing and drying the sheets—provided a grounding sensory experience that helped her regulate her nervous system. Through the B-type program, she turned this therapeutic practice into a sustainable business, pioneering techniques to create paper from banana fibers, pineapple leaves, and other agricultural byproducts from Ishigaki's farms. Mei is passionate about zero-waste production and often incorporates pressed flowers, leaves, and even thread from worn-out kimono fabric into her papers."
